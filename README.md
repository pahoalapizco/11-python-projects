# Welcome to 11 python projects :snake:

In this repo you'll find eleven basic projects that I crerated to improve my coding skills using python.  

I hope you like them as well as I did, in case you have feedback on any project please tell me by DM or make a pull request.

## Project #1 `Odd numbers`
In this little project has two functions 

`is_odd(num: int)`: Evaluate if a number is odd or not.
<br/>
`play()`: It asks the user to type a number between 1 and 1000 and then evaluate if that number is odd or not.

### **Run this project:**
```
python3 odd_numers.py
```

**Output**
```
Type a number between 1 and 1000 to evaluate if is an odd number: 1001
Type a number between 1 and 1000 to evaluate if is an odd number: hello
Type a number between 1 and 1000 to evaluate if is an odd number: 8
8 is not an odd number
```
